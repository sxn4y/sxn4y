## Hello!


I'm **Sanay**, a student and developer based in _Dubai_.

My main tech stack is React, Typescript, Java and C++.

I am learning **Rust** and **CUDA**, and my favourite tools are VSCode, Figma, and IntelliJ IDEA.

I build curiosities of mine that seem challenging and useful.

If it makes sense and is original, I'll publish it.

This is always only the beginning! Be sure to be on the lookout for more **_awesome_** Projects 😊.
